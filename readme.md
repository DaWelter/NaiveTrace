ToyTrace
========
Born out of an ancient computer graphics exercise, this is my hobby renderer.

This is experimental software. I do not claim that it is fit for any particular purpose. Rather it is an expression of my interest in graphics.

Dependencies:

* CIMG
* Eigen 3
* boost
* assimp
* OpenImageIO
* yaml-cpp
* tbb

On Ubuntu 16 there is an issue with yaml-cpp and OpenImageIO. I prefer the latest yaml-cpp (0.6) but OpenImageIO links to an older version (0.3). Therefore I suggest to build and install OpenImageIO from sources.

Maybe Toytrace compiles with VC, but you'd need to have the dependencies as well ofc.

Features
--------
* Forward path tracing with next event estimation.
* Bidirectional path tracing.
* Participating media:
    * Homogeneous chromatic collision coefficients.
    * Atmosphere model with tabulated altitude profiles.
    * Uniform-, Henley-Greenstein- and Rayleigh phase functions.
    * Spectral delta tracking.
* Materials:
    * Glossy microfacet metallic BRDF.
    * Dense dielectric with specular interface.
    * Specular mirror.
    * Specular transmissive dielectric, aka. glass shader.
    * Lambertian diffuse.
* Textures & UV mapping.
* Lights:
    * Isotropic homogeneous area.
    * Parallel area.
    * Infinitely distant, including a sun model with realistic spectrum.
    * Isotropic sky dome.
    * Point.
    * Image based lighting / HRD environment map.
    * Emissive Media (work in progress)
* Camera:
    * Pinhole.
    * Fisheye.
* Statistical test for BSDF & Phasefunction sampling routines.
* Embree for fast ray triangle intersections. 
* Binned spectral representation.
* Multithreading.
* Automated rendering of test scenes.

Todo
----
Eventually, maybe, and in no particular order.

* Advanced techniques. VCM and beam radiance estimators as extension of VCM would be nice.
* Custom triangle intersection routines with double precision. Embree only for BVH.
* Robust intersection computations in the style of BPRT.
* Overlapping media volumes in the sense that a mixture medium comprising multiple components is rendered.
* Rendering of OpenVDB data set.
* Other geometries for the atmosphere medium: Flat (Earth) and (O'Neill) Cylinder.
* Faster MIS weight computation from the VCM paper.
* A multi-layer material.
* A sane scene description format.
* Better image reconstruction filter.
* Wavelength dependent index of refraction.
* Firefly suppression.
* Quasi-random sampling.
* Bloom filter.
* Physical camera.
* Texture filtering.
* Bump/normal mapping.

There is another ToyTrace on Github. I have nothing to do with it. I just happen to forget to check if the name is already assigned.
