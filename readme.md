This is experimental software. It works on my computer. It might not on yours.

Dependencies:

* CIMG
* Eigen 3
* boost
* assimp

Builds on Ubuntu 16 with default gcc. Maybe it compiles with VC, but you'd need to have the dependencies as well ofc.

Features
--------
* Forward path tracing with next event estimation
* Bidirectional path tracing
* Participating media:
    * Homogeneous chromatic collision coefficients
    * Atmosphere model with tabulated altitude profiles
    * Uniform-, Henley-Greenstein- and Rayleigh phase functions
    * Spectral delta tracking
* Materials:
    * Glossy microfacet metallic BRDF
    * Dense dielectric with specular interface
    * Specular mirror
    * Pure diffuse
* Textures & UV mapping
* Lights:
    * Isotropic homogeneous area
    * Parallel area
    * Infinitely distant, including a sun model with realistic spectrum
    * Isotropic sky dome
    * Point
* Camera:
    * Pinhole
    * Fisheye
* Statistical test for BSDF & Phasefunction sampling routines.
* Naive Kd-tree
* Binned spectral representation
* Multithreading
* Automated rendering of test scenes.

Not Implemented
---------------
Eventually, maybe ...

* Advanced techniques. Beam radiance estimators or MLT.
* Refractive interfaces
* SAH based Kd-tree or BVH construction
* Designed for data locality and cache performance
* Ray packet traversal and coherence improving ray-reordering
* Robust intersection computations in the style of BPRT.
* Or just using Intel's Embree
* Glossy dielectric
* Inhomogeneous media apart from atmospheric models
* Faster MIS weight computation from the VCM paper
* Better image reconstruction filter
* Firefly suppression
* Stratified/quasi-random sampling
* Image based lighting
* Bloom filter
* Physical camera
* Texture filtering
* Bump/normal mapping

There is another ToyTrace on Github. I have nothing to do with it. I just happen to forget to check if the name is already assigned.
